# Playground

A personal **Playground** repository for experimenting, learning, and prototyping.

This repo is intentionally flexible and may contain small demos, throwaway experiments, 
notes, or proofs of concept across different languages and technologies.

---

## 📌 Purpose

+ Try out new ideas quickly
+ Test libraries, frameworks, or algorithms
+ Keep minimal reproducible examples
+ Store learning artifacts and code snippets

Nothing here is guaranteed to be production-ready.

## 🧩 Structure

The structure may evolve over time, but typically follows patterns like:

```
playground/
├── language-or-topic-1/
│   ├── experiment-a/
│   └── notes.md
├── language-or-topic-2/
│   └── demo/
└── README.md
```

Each folder is usually self-contained and documents its own setup or intent.

## 🚀 Getting Started
